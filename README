1. Introduction
“There must be a language that doesn't depend on words, the boy thought. I've already
had that experience with my sheep, and now it's happening with people.”[1]
-Paulo Coelho “The Alchemist”
These words by the author speak of a universal language understood by all the living
beings –men and animals alike. Though, such a language may have existed –we have for
long forgotten its usage. Today, even with the internet bringing the people together to
make a global village, there still exists a barrier between people called –“Language”.
There are numerous email services, chat messengers, voice and video conferencing tools
existing today, however they are useful only when the medium of communication- the
language- is same at all ends. Else, they are of little use.
To overcome this last hurdle in bringing the people from various geographies, cultures,
linguistics together-we planned to build a chat messenger which enabled people to send
and receive messages in their own languages irrespective of what language the person at
other end was using.

1.1 Review of the present scenario and the proposed solution
The traditional and unchanged method of conversation between the people speaking
different languages is to engage a translator between them. But, it is not always feasible
and possible to deploy human translators for all the conversations.
The advancements of computing and machine learning have led to the development of
computer based translators. Though they solve the former problem to a large extent, their
application in real time communication is hindered by following short comes:
 Standalone applications for translation like IMtranslator.
Not integrated with messengers and copy-paste procedures are not feasible for
instant messaging or any sort of real time communication.
 Add-ons and plug-ins like Microsoft TBOT which support only specific
messengers like Windows Live messenger.
 Other paid services with support for only few international languages. No service
available for Indian languages like Hindi.
 Even with few applications providing translation services, interfaces still in
English.

1.1.1 The proposed solution:
To overcome the above problems, we aim at building the Cross Language Insta-Translate
Messenger which is an open source instant messenger just like Yahoo Messenger or AIM
with facilities such as one to one text messaging, conference rooms, emoticons etc. but
unlike them has some unique features like:
 Translation built into it using the Google Translation API [2] which
enables a very convenient and easy way for text chatting between people of
different languages.
 It also provides the interface in the language, the user desires.

1.2 Application fields of the proposed solution
The proposed Cross Language Insta-Translate Messenger can be of great use in many day
to day applications. The application fields range from hospitality industry to corporate
world. We see few examples of its usage as below:
 A hotel can install this application in all its rooms and kiosks and
maintain a central customer support server. Whenever a tourist speaking a
different language wants to know some information, he can easily chat with the
customer service desk in his own language irrespective of whether the people at
the desk don’t know his language or not.
 In a software development company, like the one in which we did our
project, there is many a times need of collaboration between people from various
geographies like Europe and East Asian countries like China, Korea, Japan etc..
Most of the times communicating with them can become a problem as not very
comfortable with English. Our solution is very useful in solving this problem.
 Apart from these specific applications, there can many useful
applications that may spring up in our daily life-like a – grandparent in Uttar
Pradesh can chat using this solution with his grandson in USA who doesn’t know
Hindi. Or it may even be a simple time-pass chat between a Serb and an Arab
which may lead to a valuable cultural exchange.
 Thus with our proposed solution supporting many languages like
French, German, Finnish, Czech, Serbian etc. and our own Indian language Hindi,
the applications are bound to be many.
